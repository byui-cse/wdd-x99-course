Business Owner (BO): Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining this meeting. As you know, we've been exploring ways to leverage data to better understand our business and make informed decisions. Today, we have our consulting team here to discuss the progress on building our data analytics pipeline.

BO: So, let's dive in. How's the progress on designing and creating the data analytics pipeline?

CT: We've made significant strides in designing and cost-optimizing the solution. Before we proceed to build, we want to ensure that it aligns with your needs and is cost-effective.

MT: That sounds great. Can you elaborate on how you plan to capture and analyze the clickstream data?

CT: Certainly. We'll be ingesting access_log data from the café web server. To ensure functionality and provide insights, we'll transform the data and use simulated log data for testing purposes.

BO: That's good to hear. I'm keen on gaining insights from this data. Can you give us an idea of what insights we can expect?

CT: Absolutely. By analyzing the clickstream data, we'll be able to understand user behavior on our website. This information will help us focus our advertising efforts effectively and even make decisions on where to open additional café locations.

BO: Impressive. Now, I understand there are some additional requirements you've been working on. Could you share those with the group?

CT: Of course. We've been asked to incorporate geolocation information for website visitors and develop a visual dashboard to gain insights. The dashboard will include various metrics such as the top cities and regions with the most website visitors, those who accessed the menu page, and those who made a purchase. Additionally, we'll provide the ability to store access logs in Amazon S3 and query them using SQL.

MT: That sounds incredibly useful for our marketing efforts. Being able to pinpoint where our website visitors are coming from will greatly enhance our targeting strategies.

BO: Agreed. Overall, I'm impressed with the progress and the direction we're headed. Thank you all for your hard work.
