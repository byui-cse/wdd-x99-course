<h2 id="scenario-southern-la-volleyball-association">Scenario: Southern LA Volleyball Association</h2>
<p>Southern LA Volleyball Association hosts volleyball tournaments year-round across hundreds of venues in Southern California. These tournaments attract players from various parts of the nation, creating a vibrant and dynamic environment. However, as the association adds more and more tournaments managing the logistics of these tournaments has become cumbersome and expensive. The association currently relies on printing large-format pool charts and tournament brackets for each venue, leading to logistical challenges and increased costs.</p>
<p>To address these issues, the association aims to develop a digital solution that simplifies the process and enhances the overall experience for players and parents. This case study will task student teams with designing and implementing a cloud-based application to streamline tournament management and improve communication among stakeholders.</p>
<h3 id="general-tournament-information">General Tournament Information</h3>
<ul>
<li>Each tournament has between 8 and 32 teams. </li>
<li>Teams play in <em>pool play</em> and then based on their results in pool play, they are seeded into brackets.</li>
<li>Seeding is based on pool ranking (1st, 2nd, etc), then wins, then points differential.</li>
<li>Brackets are in groups of 4, 8, or 12 teams. (8 team brackets are most common)</li>
<li>Each team is assigned to a 4 team pool and plays all teams in their pool. Each pool is assigned a single court.</li>
<li>Each match consists of 2 sets in pool play, which means there could be ties in pool play. Each match in bracket play is best 2 out of 3.<ul>
<li>If there are only 3 teams in a pool, they play the other 2 teams for 3 sets instead of 2.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Each location has between 1 and 4 courts.</li>
<li>Each location has a site director who is responsible for writing scores on the pool sheets and brackets.</li>
<li>Once pool play is finished, teams travel to the location of the bracket they are playing in. e.g. Gold, Silver, Bronze, Diamond</li>
<li>All teams in a bracket will be at one location.</li>
</ul>

    <h5>Jena, Association President</h5>
    <blockquote><p>Well, one major issue we're facing is the reliance on printed pool charts and tournament brackets. Not only is this expensive, but it also creates logistical challenges as we have to get them printed and delivered for each venue. This becomes a real problem as we have teams drop, add, or change just days before the tournaments.</p>
    <p>We also use dispersed gyms for our large tournaments, so communication between gyms to figure out overall rankings is a nightmare. Gathering the results from each of the gyms is a headache. On top of this, once teams finish their pool play, they must get to the gym that has their bracket. We've had teams go to the wrong gym, or sit around waiting to find out where to go, not realizing that results had been posted. These inefficiencies make tournaments last longer than is needed. Add this to travel times and a long day becomes almost unbearably long.</p>
    <p>We didn't have these issues when we were running smaller tournaments that fit in a single gym, but our new growth has caused some major growing pains.</p>

    <blockquote><p>Jena, I've been watching how players and parents interact with the pools and brackets at the tournaments. Some players and parents take pictures of the pools when they enter the gym and then try to keep track by drawing on the images.</p><p>Additionally, I've noticed that other parents tend to walk out of the stands during matches to check the updated brackets. Or they crowd around the pool sheets as the site director is writing and updating the information. This is pretty intimidating for the site directors and this disrupts the flow of the tournament and detracts from the overall experience.</p></blockquote>

    <blockquote><p>Exactly. Furthermore, we've been experiencing issues with players not showing up for their reffing assignments and line judge duties. Despite our efforts to communicate these responsibilities, it seems that some players aren't understanding the sheets or just forget when they are supposed to help. This makes the tournament slow down since the officials have to track down the coaches and teams before the next match can begin.</p></blockquote>
