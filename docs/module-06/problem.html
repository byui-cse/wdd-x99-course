<h2 id="scenario">Scenario</h2>
<h3 id="frazils-slushie-as-a-service-pioneering-subscription-business-model">Frazil's 'slushie-as-a-service' pioneering subscription business model</h3>
<p>Frazil started in 2024 with the intent to solve the most pressing issues within the slush category. One issue was flavor profile, and the quality of the flavors used in the market (the consumer pain), but one of the other significant sources of pain was for the retailers. They didn't want to be in the "equipment and service business". They didn't want to manage a slush machine when it breaks down, stock spare parts, and take on that complexity. They didn't want to take on the financial risk of buying equipment either, often making a 10-year commitment to a category they were still exploring.</p>
<p>Enter Frazil. Frazil provides the retailer with a machine for use in their store. Frazil retains ownership of that machine, and takes care of all reactive service needs, at no cost to the retailer. The retailer must purchase a certain minimum number of cases per year to remain compliant with the program, and to keep the machine in their store. The retailer is making a profit from DAY 1 of the program. There is no payback period. They also can focus on their core business, instead of needing to manage a host of issues related to machine service and management.  </p>
<p>Because Frazil bears the operational and financial risk of managing a fleet of machines across the U.S. on behalf of its customers, understanding when a machine is on, working and full is critical to their survival. Frazil is obsessed with maximizing the amount a store can sell per machine in a store. Given this business model dependency, retailers who convert to the Frazil program will realize the benefits of this obsession through increased cups sold per store per year. </p>
<p>To help facilitate this growth Frazil has developed a "slushie as a service" product team to help retailers understand and execute principles that will <strong>increase their ability to sell more slushies per machine in their store</strong>. Frazil has already tasked the IoT product team with integrating sensors in all of their machines to facilitate the next stage of transformation in how the slush category is managed across the retail environment. The future of the frozen beverage category is already here, and the category is now leading the way for many other categories in the retail environment as well. </p>

    <h5>Kyle Freebairn, CEO</h5>
    <blockquote><p>Welcome. We've recognized that one of the key reasons the 50-year old slushie industry is suffering from sluggish growth isn't that consumers have lost interest in frozen drinks: but that the appearance of machines and freshness of the slushie on offer often leaves a lot to be desired.</p>

    <h5>Adetola Afolabi, Product Owner</h5>
    <blockquote><p>In addition, the hassle and cost of having to buy and maintain a machine was a real hassle for retailers, too. So, slushies had lost their appeal to consumers and retailers, and we have to completely change that. And what we came up with was our 'slushie-as-a-service' modified subscription business model that really enables retailers to hit the 'easy button' when it comes to slushies. All a retailer must do is simply buy cases of product from their partnering distributor, and other than very minimal routine cleaning, we do all the maintenance, servicing, and monitoring.</p>

    <h5>Kyle Freebairn, CEO</h5>
    <blockquote><p>We invested in developing a range of new flavors that employed higher quality ingredients than traditional slushies. We don't sweeten with high-fructose corn syrup, but real, natural sugar. Our gamble is that a quality product would drive category growth. We've found that consumers haven't fallen out of favor with fresh, ice-cold, delicious slushies, they've fallen out of favor with a poor customer experience that didn't focus on delighting the consumer. That's what we're focused on fixing. And now with the cellular IoT enhancement, our customers won't even have to phone us for most issues; if they have a problem, we'll know before they do.</p>

    <blockquote><p>What's more our initial trials have demonstrated that the costs of moving to a cellular IoT solution are more than offset by the increase in revenue and profits that comes from significantly cutting down on downtime by being far more proactive at spotting and quickly solving potential issues.</p>

    <blockquote><p>We believe that large chains that use our real-time slushie/Frazil reporting dashboard can use it as a window into their broader store operations.</p><p>World-class retailers recognize that operational excellence and the in-store experience is one of the key pillars required to win in today's retail environment.  We believe there is a strong correlation between how well they manage (or don't manage) their Frazil program, and how well they manage (or don't manage) other aspects of retail excellence. The management teams and category managers couldn't be more excited at the operational visibility this type of offering provides.</p>

    <blockquote><p>Our task is to create a product for refrigeration remote monitoring solution that offer more data and bring value to retailers. The guiding principle is that any information collected through the IoT should be displayed in a way that is easy to consume for those looking for insight, and that the insights are somehow actionable. This includes additional chores that Frazil can take off its retailer customers’ plates.</p>
