## Final Team Presenations

### Final Presentation Guide: Showcasing Your Product


You’ve been preparing for this moment throughout the semester. Each sprint demo helped sharpen your communication and gave you real-time feedback on your progress. Now it’s time to bring it all together in a polished presentation that showcases your team’s journey, your product’s value, and what you’ve learned along the way.

### Before the Presentation: Prepare Like a Pro

1. **Know Your Audience**  
   You’ll be presenting to instructors and real industry professionals—people who care about innovation, value, and customer focus. Tailor your story accordingly.

2. **Tell the Product Story**  
Use a clear narrative structure:  

    - *The Problem*: What challenge were you solving?  
    - *The Solution*: How does your product solve it?  
    - *The Journey*: What did you learn through design, testing, and iteration?  
    - *The Outcome*: What exists now that didn’t at the beginning of the semester?

3. **Show the Product**  
Don’t just talk—**demo it**. Walk them through a live version or a recorded walkthrough. Highlight key interactions, polish the visuals, and make sure it works.

4. **Split the Roles**  
Everyone should have a speaking part. Assign roles like:  

    - Introduction / Problem  
    - Design Decisions  
    - Customer Validation  
    - Demo Walkthrough  
    - What We’d Do Next  
    - Closing

5. **Anticipate Questions**  
Review each sprint’s feedback and think:

    - What will they ask?  
    - What challenges did we face and how did we handle them?  
    - Why did we choose this solution?

6. **Practice, Practice, Practice**  
Rehearse it like a real event—timed, smooth, confident. Record yourselves if needed and refine. Check your tech setup: internet, microphone, screen sharing, backups.

### During the Presentation: Engage and Impress

1. **Start Strong**  
   Open with energy. Share the problem clearly and why it matters. Your audience should care in the first 60 seconds.

2. **Keep It Tight and Clear**  
   Aim for 7–10 minutes of total presentation time. Focus on what’s essential—don’t list every feature or bug fix.

3. **Show Real Learning**  
   Talk about feedback you received and how it shaped the product. Show that you were listening to customers and adapting.

4. **Highlight Each Person’s Contribution**  
   Share what each teammate brought to the table—design, code, research, testing, etc. This is your moment to shine *as a team*.

5. **Invite Questions (and Own the Answers)**  
   Stay calm and honest. It’s okay to say “That’s something we’d love to explore more,” or “We hadn’t thought of that—great point.”

## 🎯 Final Reminders

- You’ve done this before—your sprint demos were practice for this moment.  
- Be confident, even if the product isn’t “perfect.” Show how much you’ve learned and how far you’ve come.  
- Speak with purpose and passion. If you're excited about the product, your audience will be too.  
- Thank your audience—especially the industry guests—for their time and attention.
