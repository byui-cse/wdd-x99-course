## Phases

This project is broken into 9 phases:



<div class="phase-table"></div>

| Phase          | Detail   | Solution requirement  |
| :---        |    :----   |          ---: |
|1               | Create an architecture diagram and cost estimate for the solution.	|R1, R2|
|2|	Analyze the design of the monolithic application and test the application.|	R3|
|3|	Create a development environment on AWS Cloud9, and check the monolithic source code into CodeCommit.	|R3|
|4|	Break the monolithic design into microservices, and launch test Docker containers.	|R3, R4|
|5|	Create ECR repositories to store Docker images. Create an ECS cluster, ECS task definitions, and CodeDeploy application specification files.|	R3|
|6|	Create target groups and an Application Load Balancer that routes web traffic to them.	|R5|
|7|	Create ECS services.	|R5|
|8|	Configure applications and deployments groups in CodeDeploy, and create two CI/CD pipelines by using CodePipeline.|	R5, R6|
|9|	Modify your microservices and scale capacity, and use the pipelines that you created to deploy iterative improvements to production by using a blue/green deployment strategy.|	R5, R6|
