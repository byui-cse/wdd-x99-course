## Marshmallow Challenge

[TED Talk video](https://youtu.be/H0_yKBitO8M?si=dQWHzFU98VNd9t1Y)


## Prototype

* Use tools that let you build a quick and dirty
prototype while involving every member of your
team.
* You can quickly try out ideas, make modifications,
and refine your end product.

## Iterate
* Sketch out the plan so that your team doesn’t
waste time on planning again and again.
* This saves a bunch of time because if something
isn’t quite right, you can trash it and quickly start
again.

# PREP
In advance of the meeting, create a marshmallow challenge kit for each team, with each
kit containing twenty sticks of spaghetti, one yard of masking tape, one yard of string and
one marshmallow. These ingredients should be placed into a paper lunch bag, which
simplifies distribution and hides the contents, maximizing the element of surprise.

1. Spaghetti: Ensure that you use uncooked spaghetti. Avoid spaghettini as it is too
thin and breaks easily. Fettucini is too thick.
2. String: Include string that can be easily broken by hand. If the string is thick,
include scissors in your kit.
3. Marshmallow: Use a name brand or private label brand of marshmallows that
measure the ‘standard’ size, about an inch an a half across. Avoid mini or jumbo
marshmallows. Also avoid stale marshmallows. You’ll want squishy
marshmallows that give the impression of lightness.
4. Masking Tape: Get standard masking tape. Generally, you’ll want to put the tape
on the side of the table, the back of a chair or a nearby wall. Rolling it in the bag
tangles the tape.
5. Paper Lunch Bags: Standard size lunch bags work well as do letter size manilla
envelops.
Also ensure that you have the following tools to run the challenge:
6. Measuring Tape: Have a contractor’s retractable measuring available after the
challenge is finished so you can measure the height of the structures.
