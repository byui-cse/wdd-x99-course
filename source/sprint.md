**Course Structure: Sprint-Based Product Development**

## **Sprint Breakdown and Instructions**

### **Sprint 1: Design Sprint (Based on *Sprint* by Jake Knapp)**

**Objective:** Develop and validate a problem worth solving, create a prototype concept.

**Activities:** 

- Identify a real-world problem and potential customer segment.
- Conduct rapid research (e.g., interviews, surveys) to validate problem significance.
- Storyboard potential solutions.
- Build a low-fidelity prototype (wireframes, clickable mockups, or other forms of visualization).
- Conduct initial user testing and collect feedback.
- Present findings to class for feedback.
- **SVPG Integration:** Emphasize early identification of value and business risks to ensure product viability. Encourage collaborative brainstorming among cross-functional teams.

**Deliverables:**  

- Problem statement and customer profile.  
- Low-fidelity prototype and feedback summary.  
- Sprint reflection (written or video).

### **Sprint 2: Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Development**

**Objective:** Build an initial interactive version of the product.

**Activities:**  

- Define core features based on feedback from Sprint 1.
- Develop a basic working version of the product (landing page, prototype, or simple functional feature).
- Plan validation methods (e.g., usability testing, A/B testing, sign-up interest forms).
- Conduct another round of user feedback.
- **SVPG Integration:** Foster continuous product discovery by designing and validating solutions that are usable, useful, and feasible. Empower teams to make early decisions and iterate rapidly.

**Deliverables:**  
- Basic interactive MVP.  
- Usability testing report or validation data.  
- Sprint reflection.

### **Sprint 3: Feature Expansion and User Engagement**

**Objective:** Expand product features and improve usability.

**Activities:**  

- Add or refine features based on Sprint 2 feedback.
- Develop user engagement strategies (e.g., email sign-ups, social media interest, interactive elements).
- Test usability and user adoption.
- **SVPG Integration:** Encourage problem-solving over rigid feature roadmaps by refining features based on real user needs. Promote collaboration between engineering, design, and product teams.

**Deliverables:**  

- Enhanced version of MVP with added functionality.  
- User engagement strategy and validation results.  
- Sprint reflection.

### **Sprint 4: Market Validation and Refinement**

**Objective:** Validate demand and improve user experience.

**Activities:**  

- Implement A/B testing or collect analytics on user interactions.
- Improve performance and UX/UI based on data.
- Address usability and customer concerns.
- Run marketing experiments (e.g., social media campaigns, targeted surveys).
- **SVPG Integration:** Implement analytics-driven decision-making and continuous discovery to refine usability and validate market demand.

**Deliverables:** 

- Usability improvements and validation data.  
- Market validation strategy and findings.  
- Sprint reflection.

### **Sprint 5: Scaling and Product Readiness**

**Objective:** Prepare for launch by refining core aspects of the product.

**Activities:**  

- Strengthen backend/frontend functionality.
- Improve product stability and user experience.
- Conduct additional testing with users.
- Develop pitch materials for final showcase.
- **SVPG Integration:** Encourage investment in empathy, critical thinking, and creativity to prepare for future challenges. Develop final refinements based on data-driven insights.

**Deliverables:** 

- Product nearing final version.  
- Pitch deck for final presentation.  
- Sprint reflection.

### **Sprint 6: Final Presentation and Showcase**

**Objective:** Present product to industry professionals.

**Activities:**  

- Finalize product and prepare for live demo.
- Present to industry professionals for feedback.
- Reflect on learnings and contributions.
- **SVPG Integration:** Highlight the importance of team empowerment, problem-solving skills, and creativity in product development.

**Deliverables:**  

- Live product demo or walkthrough.  
- Final presentation.  
- Individual reflections.

## **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) Integration**

Each sprint aligns with the Software Development Lifecycle stages:

- **Planning:** Conducted in Sprint 1 with problem identification and research.
- **Analysis:** User needs and demand validation in Sprints 1 & 2.
- **Design:** Wireframes, prototypes, and MVP planning in Sprints 1 & 2.
- **Implementation:** MVP and iterative development in Sprints 2-5.
- **Testing:** Continuous user testing, A/B tests, and validation throughout.
- **Deployment:** Final product rollout in Sprint 6.
- **Maintenance & Iteration:** Addressing feedback and future recommendations post-launch.

## **Assessments**

- **Sprint Reflections:** Evaluate individual contributions, learnings, and improvements (written/video). Assess how well students integrate continuous discovery and problem-solving principles.
- **MVP and Feature Demos:** Assessed based on progress, usability, engagement, and problem-solving effectiveness.
- **User Validation Reports:** Show evidence of testing, surveys, and user engagement, with a focus on tackling major risks early and refining based on data.
- **Final Presentation:** Industry professionals provide feedback, with an emphasis on how well teams have demonstrated user empathy, collaboration, and innovative problem-solving.

This framework ensures students build something meaningful while experiencing real-world product development challenges, integrating best practices from the Silicon Valley Product Group.
