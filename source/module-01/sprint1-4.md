### Goal: Build a realistic, testable prototype

Phase 4 is a fast-paced day of building. The team creates a realistic facade of the product, designed to simulate how it would work in real life. It doesn't need to be fully functional—just believable enough to get meaningful feedback from users. The goal is to spend just one day building something good enough to test during Phase 5.

* Divide tasks among team members (design, copy, build, etc.)
    - Assign clear roles:
    - Product Manger - Writer
    - Product Designer - Stitcher
    - Product Developer - Asset Collector
* Use the storyboard from Phase 3 as a blueprint
* Focus on speed: aim for a realistic surface, not full functionality
* Use tools like Figma, Google Slides, or Miro for rapid creation
    - Create fake data or screens if needed to simulate realism
* Do a dry run of the prototype at the end of the day
* Prepare everything needed for Phase 5’s test

### Checklist

- [ ] **Pick the right tool** Probably going to be Canva for our product
- [ ] **Roles and work!** Asset collector, maker, stitcher, everyone can work on Canva at the same time.
- [ ] **Prototype** Build the façade in Canva. Build, build, build. Then run through your prototype


**Outcome: A prototype that feels real enough for users to test.**
