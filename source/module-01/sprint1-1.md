### Goal: Define the problem and set a long-term goal

During Phase 1 of the Design Sprint, the team focuses on understanding the problem from all angles. The most important task is creating a customer journey map, which visually outlines the user’s experience and highlights key pain points and opportunities. This shared map becomes the foundation for everything that follows in the sprint. It helps everyone align on the context and agree on a specific focus for the week—typically one moment or decision point on the map that’s worth solving.

* Start with a map of the challenge or user journey
    - Start by defining the long-term goal (where you want to be in 6–12 months)
    - List out all key actors: customers, users, systems, etc.
    - Map out the steps of a typical user journey from start to finish
    - Keep the map simple (no need to diagram everything)
* Bring in experts to share insights (via interviews or lightning talks). *We'll do this by cross pollination by teams.*
    - Mark areas of uncertainty, pain, or opportunity
* Align on the long-term goal and identify the week's key question
* Choose a specific target area to focus on

**Outcome: A shared understanding of the challenge and a clear focus for the sprint.**
