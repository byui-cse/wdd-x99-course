### Goal: Define the problem and set a long-term goal

During Phase 1 of the Design Sprint, the team focuses on understanding the problem from all angles. The most important task is creating a customer journey map, which visually outlines the user’s experience and highlights key pain points and opportunities. This shared map becomes the foundation for everything that follows in the sprint. It helps everyone align on the context and agree on a specific focus for the week—typically one moment or decision point on the map that’s worth solving.

1. Describe our product
2. What need does it solve
3. Who is using it currently, or who would we like to use it
4. If everything went smoothly, what would the product look like in 2 years

## Product Opportunity Assessment [link](https://www.svpg.com/assessing-product-opportunities/)

1. Exactly what problem will this solve? (value proposition)
2. For whom do we solve that problem? (target market)
3. How big is the opportunity? (market size)
4. What alternatives are out there? (competitive landscape)
5. Why are we best suited to pursue this? (our differentiator)
6. Why now? (market window)
7. How will we get this product to market? (go-to-market strategy)
8. How will we measure success/make money from this product? (metrics/revenue strategy)
9. What factors are critical to success? (solution requirements)
10. Given the above, what’s the recommendation? (go or no-go)

* Bring in experts to share insights (via interviews or lightning talks). 
    - Mark areas of uncertainty, pain, or opportunity
    - How might we???
* Start with a map of the challenge or user journey
    - Start by defining the long-term goal (where you want to be in 6–12 months)
    - List out all key actors: customers, users, systems, etc.
    - Map out the steps of a typical user journey from start to finish
    - Keep the map simple (no need to diagram everything)
* Align on the long-term goal and identify the week's key question
* Choose a specific target area to focus on

### Checklist

- [ ] **Set a long-term goal** Get optimistic. Ask: Why are we doing this product? Where do we want to be in six-months, a year, or even five? Write the long-term goal on the whiteboard.
- [ ] **List sprint questions** Get pessimistic. Ask: How could we fail? Turn these into question you could answer this week. List them on the whiteboard.
- [ ] **Make a map** List customer and key players on the left. Draw the ending, with your completed goal on the right. Make a flowchart between showing how customers interact with your product. Keep is simple: 5-15 steps.
- [ ] **Ask the Experts** Interview experts on you sprint team and guests from the outside. Ask about vision, customer research, how things work, and previous efforts. Update the long-term goal, questions, and map as you go.
- [ ] **Explain How Might We notes** Reframe problems as opportunities. Start with HWM (how might we) on the sticky notes. Write one idea per sticky note.
- [ ] **Organize HMW notes** Stick the HMW notes on the wall. Move like ideas near each other. Label them as they emerge. Don’t perfect it.
- [ ] **Vote on HWM notes** Use stickers to vote for HMW. Move winners to map.
- [ ] **Pick a target** Circle the most important customer and one target moment on the wall. Product Manager makes the final call.


**Outcome: A shared understanding of the challenge and a clear focus for the sprint.**
