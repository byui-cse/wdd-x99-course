## Module 01 - Sprint 1 "The Design Sprint"

Selecting a product that truly resonates with customers is the most important step in the product development journey. In this sprint, we won’t just brainstorm ideas—we’ll validate them. You’ll identify a real problem, propose a solution, and build a realistic product *facade* (prototype) that you’ll test directly with potential users. This process helps ensure that you’re not just building something cool—you’re building something *people actually want*.

This sprint stands apart from all the others this semester. It’s about *starting strong*. Using the proven methodology from Sprint by Jake Knapp at Google Ventures, your team will move quickly from insight to idea to tested prototype—all in two weeks. By the end of this sprint, you’ll have real customer feedback, a working prototype, and a clear sense of whether your product has the potential to succeed.

#### Quick Introduction Video to the Design Sprint

While many of the videos and resources describe the Design Sprint as a five-day process, we’ll be spreading it out across weeks 2 and 3 of the semester. This gives your team time to dive deeper into each phase while still moving quickly from idea to tested prototype.
