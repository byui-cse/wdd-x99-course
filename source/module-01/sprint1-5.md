### Goal: Validate ideas through user feedback

The most crucial task on Friday is running five one-on-one interviews with real users. This helps the team quickly validate their prototype. Interviewing just five people is usually enough to spot big problems and get directional feedback. The interviews are conducted using a consistent script, and team members silently observe to capture insights.

### Five Act Interview

* Conduct 5 one-on-one user interviews
    - Use a test script: warm-up questions, task prompts, open-ended follow-ups
* Watch and note what works, what’s confusing, and what fails
    - Assign roles: interviewer, note-taker, observers (watch quietly)
    - Watch for reactions, confusion, and “aha” moments
    - Use a video call with screen sharing or an in-person test setup
* Debrief as a team and identify patterns
    - Summarize findings and decide on the next steps: iterate, pivot, or ship
