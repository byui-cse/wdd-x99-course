### Goal: Choose the best ideas to prototype

Phase 3 is decision day. The team selects which ideas to prototype based on clarity, feasibility, and impact. The most important task is building a *storyboard*, a step-by-step visual plan for the prototype that will be built on Thursday. It ensures everyone agrees on the exact flow and interactions the prototype should include. This storyboard becomes the playbook for building.

### Storyboarding Tips

* Review and critique the solution sketches
    - Review all anonymous sketches silently (“Art Museum” walk)
    - Use sticky dot voting to highlight interesting elements
* Discuss and debate top ideas
    - Use a decision-making method (like a Product Manager vote) to break ties
* Create a storyboard for the prototype (step-by-step plan)
    - Sketch a 6–8 frame storyboard on a whiteboard or large paper
    - Make the storyboard detailed enough to guide Thursday’s build
    - Keep the user’s journey and key problem in focus throughout

- [ ] **Art museum** put sketches where everyone can see them.
- [ ] **Heat map** each person add small stickers to every part they like
- [ ] **Speed critique** Discuss highlights of each solution, capture standout ideas.
- [ ] **Vote with Stickers** vote on your favorite idea.
- [ ] **Remove maybe laters** Put super vote ideas together
- [ ] **Decide** Decide if you can do all super vote ideas or if they need to be split up to test against each other or if they go in a later sprint.
- [ ] **Make a storyboard** Draw a 15 square grid. Choose an opening scene (how do people get introduced to your product. Fill in storyboard. Just enough info to fill in prototype.


**Outcome: A clear, team-approved plan for what will be prototyped.**
