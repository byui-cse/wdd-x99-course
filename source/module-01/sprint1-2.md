### Goal: Generate a wide range of solutions

Phase 2 of the Design Sprint is all about idea generation, and the key activity is having each person sketch a detailed solution. Instead of brainstorming out loud, every participant works independently to sketch their vision on paper. This ensures deep thinking, avoids groupthink, and allows every voice to be heard. The final sketch is a storyboard-style pitch that can be anonymously reviewed during Phase 3.

* Begin with “Lightning Demos” to gather inspiration from existing products
* Each team member sketches their own detailed solution ideas
* Use a structured process (e.g., “Crazy 8s”) to explore variations
    - Do “Crazy 8s”: sketch 8 versions of one idea in 8 minutes to break creative barriers
    - Use paper or digital tools (but pen and paper is often faster and better)
    - Keep the sketches anonymous—no names, no signatures
    - Use words + pictures to explain the flow or key feature of your idea
    - Think about the specific problem area selected on Monday
* End with full solution sketches that can be reviewed anonymously
* Recruit 5 customers who match your target audience to test during phase 5

**Outcome: Multiple concrete solution concepts for the team to consider.**
