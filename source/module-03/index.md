## Modules 03 - 06 - Build, Measure, Learn

In Sprints 3 through 6, your team will shift into full iteration mode. This is where the real product work happens‚Äîwhere you take everything you‚Äôve learned from earlier feedback and continue to improve, refine, and grow your product. Each sprint is an opportunity to build something meaningful, test it with real users, and learn from their reactions. You‚Äôll focus on delivering small, high-impact improvements, validating your ideas along the way, and ensuring your product evolves in a direction that actually matters to your customers. Agile isn't about perfection‚Äîit's about learning fast and getting better every sprint.

!!! time "95 Percent"

    "5 percent of entrepreneurship is the big idea, the business model, the whiteboard strategizing, and the splitting up of the spoils. The other 95 percent is the gritty work that is measured by innovation accounting: 
    
    1. product prioritization decisions
    2. deciding which customers to target or listen to
    3. having the courage to subject a grand vision to constant testing and feedback.
    
    From The Lean Startup

## Prototype vs MVP vs Shipped Product

As your product evolves, you‚Äôll move through several key stages: **prototype**, **MVP**, and eventually a **shipped product**. A *prototype* is an early, often non-functional model that helps you test ideas quickly‚Äîit might be a clickable mockup, a drawing, or a simple simulation. The goal is to explore solutions without writing full code. An *MVP (Minimum Viable Product)* is the first working version of your product that includes just enough core functionality to be used and tested by real customers. It‚Äôs not polished or feature-complete, but it should solve a real problem. A *shipped product* is what you release when you're confident in its value‚Äîit‚Äôs been refined, tested, and is ready for wider use. Each step builds on the last, and all three are essential in developing something people will actually want.



## Key Goals for Sprints 3-6:

### Sprint 3 Goals ‚Äì First Real Release

* Transform your MVP into a usable version for real customers.
* Test your product in real-world conditions with actual users.
* Prioritize fixing bugs and improving usability.
* Collect qualitative feedback (interviews, surveys, recordings).
* Validate your product is solving a real problem.

### Sprint 4 Goals ‚Äì Add Value

* Implement the most requested and impactful improvements.
* Enhance features that received positive feedback.
* Focus on usability, performance, and accessibility.
* Continue testing with real customers ‚Äî did your changes help?
* Start defining what ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù looks like with simple metrics.

### Sprint 5 Goals ‚Äì Extend & Polish

* Add new features that extend the product‚Äôs core value.
* Refactor any rushed code or designs to prepare for scaling.
* Improve visual and UX design to feel more professional.
* Test with broader audiences or different user types.
* Start preparing for your final pitch/demo presentation.

### Sprint 6 Goals ‚Äì Final Validation & Presentation

* Finalize the version of the product you‚Äôll showcase.
* Ensure it is stable, functional, and tells a clear product story.
* Create a compelling pitch that shows customer demand and understanding of customer needs.
* Run final tests to confirm user value.
* Practice your presentation and polish your deliverables.

## Reminders

!!! time "5 Keys to Agile Development"

    1. **Work in Iterations (Sprints)**: Agile breaks work into short, focused time periods called sprints (in our case, two weeks). You don‚Äôt need to build everything at once. You just need to make progress you can test, show, and learn from.

    1. **Deliver Incrementally**: Each sprint should end with something usable, testable, or interactive‚Äîeven if it's just a small piece. You‚Äôre building a product step by step, not waiting until the last week to show progress.

    1. **Solve Real Problems, Not Just Build Features**: Agile is about creating value. Ask yourself: ‚ÄúWhat problem is this solving for the user?‚Äù If you can‚Äôt answer that, you may be building the wrong thing.

    1. **Collaborate Constantly**: Agile teams communicate early and often. You‚Äôll make faster progress by checking in regularly, sharing blockers, and asking for help instead of working in silence.

    1. **Adapt and Learn**: Agile expects things to change. Customer feedback, new ideas, or technical challenges may shift your direction‚Äîand that‚Äôs okay. The goal is to learn quickly and improve.

!!! time "How to Run a Stand-Up Meeting (Daily Check-In)"

    A stand-up is a quick, focused meeting (5‚Äì10 minutes) at the start of class where every team member answers three simple questions:

    * What did I work on last time?
    * What am I working on today?
    * Do I have any blockers? (Anything slowing me down?)

    üí° Tips:

    * Everyone stands (if in person) to keep it brief and focused.
    * Be honest‚Äîthis isn‚Äôt a report for the teacher, it's for the team.
    * Keep it short. If a longer discussion is needed, save it for after the stand-up.

* *Product Discovery never stops* ‚Äì keep talking to customers even while building
* *Good products solve hard problems in valuable ways* ‚Äì don‚Äôt just aim for ‚Äúdone,‚Äù aim for ‚Äúimpactful‚Äù
* *Engineers, Designers, and Product Managers are co-owners of product success* ‚Äì decisions should never be siloed
* *The team is empowered* to identify how to solve a problem; *they also bear the responsibility* of how well that solution solves the needs of the customer.

## Software Development Lifecycle with a Modern Product Approach:

* *Planning:* Identify real customer problems through continuous discovery
* *Design:* Collaborate on lightweight, testable prototypes before investing in full builds
* *Development:* Build incrementally, prioritizing usability and business value
* *Testing:* Test early and often‚Äîuse both automated tests and real customer feedback
* *Deployment:* Ship early and frequently to learn from real-world usage
* *Maintenance:* Refine based on user behavior and emerging insights (start the process over again)
