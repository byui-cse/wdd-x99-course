## Product Management

For each module, you should assign one member of your team to be the Product Manager. Everyone on your team should serve in this role at least once. The Product Manager will assign all other teammates as Tech Leads or Product Designers.

1.  **Product Manager** - ensures that the solutions are *valuable* (our customers will buy the product and/or choose to use it), and *viable* it will meet the needs of the business.
2.  **Product Designer** - ensures that the solution is *usable*.
3.  **Tech Lead** - ensures that the solution is *feasible*.

Product Standup Meetings will be held four times per module, all during normal class time. Attendance at these meetings is mandatory. Failure to attend or come prepared will likely have an adverse effect on your module grade.

### Team Member Responsibilities

Each team member (including the Product Manager) is responsible for fulfilling the following responsibilities:

* Helping build a cost estimate for the product.

* Helping build an architecture diagram for the product.

* Attending all product standup meetings, where they will summarize the status of their work for the rest of the team and share ideas and insights regarding the work of other team members.

* Participating in the product implementation.

* Evaluating their own and their teammates' performance.

### Product Manager's Responsibilities

The product manager is responsible for fulfilling the following responsibilities:

+ Running the standup meetings for the module

+ Calling the standup meeting to order and recording attendance.

+ For each member of the team (including themselves), they:
	+ Explain what they have accomplished since the last standup
	+ Discuss what they plan on doing next
	+ Discuss any blockers they may have

+ At the end of the sprint, they oversee the creation of the product presentation, and ensure that it is turned in.


## The Product Presentation

The product presentation must include the following: title page, cost estimate, architecture diagram, and proof of implementation and completion of each phase. It should address each of the stakeholder's concerns and show completion of all requirements.

It might include bullet points, text, and visualizations. It should use proper grammar and spelling. The target audience is the executive team of the case study, not the IT team.

## Product Reflection

After the product presentation, each team member should submit a personal reflection. The reflection document contains questions designed to help you evaluate your own performance on the project, as well as the performance of your teammates.

These ratings and suggestions will be anonymously shared with the corresponding teammate, so practice professional candor. You may find this guide on ["radical candor"](https://firstround.com/review/radical-candor-the-surprising-secret-to-being-a-good-boss/) to be useful.

Example:

> Bob: 3 – Slightly Deficient. Bob, if I could give you one piece of advice going forward, it would be to make our status meetings a priority. You have amazing contributions when you’re present and engaged, so when you miss a meeting without letting us know ahead of time, it really hurts the team.

Notice that the evaluation addresses Bob directly, not the teacher. This isn't a tattle-tale session, it's an anonymous feedback exercise.

## Case Study Grade

Your final grade for each module will consist of a mix of your team's cost estimate, architectural diagram, implemenation, presentation grade, and how you rated your own performance, and how your teammates rated your performance.
