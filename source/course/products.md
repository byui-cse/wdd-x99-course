## Product Management

For each module, you should assign one member of your team to be the Product Manager. Everyone on your team should serve in this role at least once. The Product Manager will assign all other teammates as Tech Leads or Product Designers.

1.  **Product Manager** - ensures that the solutions are *valuable* (our customers will buy the product and/or choose to use it), and *viable* it will meet the needs of the business.
2.  **Product Designer** - ensures that the solution is *usable*.
3.  **Tech Lead** - ensures that the solution is *feasible*.

Product Standup Meetings will be held every module, all during normal class time. Attendance at these meetings is mandatory. Failure to attend or come prepared will result in not getting that portion of your committment card stamped.
