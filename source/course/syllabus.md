## ITM X99 Course Overview

Welcome to WDD X99 - Technology Product Development I-IV

## Course Objectives

* Explain the Product Development Cycle and the different stages a product goes through from idea to implementation.
* Explain the Software Development Lifecycle and the steps needed to design and deliver a technology product.
* Participate effectively in a small team to create the product.
* Reflect on key takeaways of the technology product development experience.
* Make a personal contribution to the product that includes outcomes from related school year courses.

!!!note "Course Textbook"

	There is no textbook for this course. All information is found on the BYU-Idaho Canvas site.

## Course Structure

This course is divided into six *sprints*. Each sprint will last approximately two weeks. Each of these sprints will be completed as teams. Each team will have a *product manager*. You will be required to provide feedback to your teammates at the end of each sprint as well as reflect on your learning.

!!! warning "Subject to Change"
	
	Keep in mind that your instructor may deviate somewhat from the following guide, and they have final say on assignment requirements, delivery methods, and due dates. So be sure to pay attention to both in-class, MS Teams, and Canvas announcements.

!!!note "Time Expectations" 
	University guidelines suggest that students spend an average of three hours per week per credit hour.

	While there will be some time provided in class for team assignments for campus students, as this is a two credit course, the expectation is that students will spend an average of four hours per week on assignments outside of class.


Each sprint is worth a percentage of your final grade:

### Sprint 01 - Design Sprint

Sprint 01 is a rapid paced effort to get a proof of concept / working prototype built which can be placed in front of users.

### Sprints 02-06

Modules 02 - 06 are iterative development on the initial product built in sprint 01. Efforts will be focused on incrementally adding features and improving the user experience of the product.

Each sprint lasts approximately two weeks. Each team will showcase their products at the end of each sprint. Progress is expected during each sprint.

Students will work in teams to create a presentation to showcase their product at the end of the semester. Students will then present their work to the class, faculty, and industry professionals. <!--Online students will post videos and campus students will present in class.--> Students will have an opportunity to reflect on their own and their teammates performance and contributions. 

## Grading

This course is pass/fail. Passing requires the following to be accomplished:

 * Must present findings from Design Sprint for working prototype.
 * Must turn in all Commitment Cards. Must have 75% or more on 5 of the 6 cards.
 * Present at Product Showcase - Must participate in the showcase. Must explain their contribution to the product.
 * Personal Interview - Individual interview at the end of the semester showing understanding of the product development lifecycle and software development lifecycle. Must explain how you incorporated concepts in your product from other courses at your grade level. Must explain what outside research was completed and how you integrated that knowledge into the product.
 

## Late Policy

Because of the team-based, interactive nature of this course, no late credit is given.

## Preventing Sexual Misconduct

BYU-Idaho prohibits sex discrimination by its employees and students in all of its education programs or activities. This includes all forms of sexual harassment, such as sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, stalking, conditioning a grade or job on participation in sexual conduct, and other forms of unwelcome sexual conduct.

As an instructor, one of my responsibilities is to help create a safe learning environment for my students and for the campus as a whole. University policy requires deans and department chairs, and encourages all faculty, to report every incident of sexual harassment that comes to their attention. If you encounter or experience sexual harassment, please contact the Title IX Coordinator at [titleix@byui.edu](mailto:titleix@byui.edu) or 208-496-9209. Additional information about sex discrimination, sexual harassment, and available resources can be found at [www.byui.edu/titleix](www.byui.edu/titleix)

## Disability Services

BYU-Idaho does not discriminate against persons with disabilities in providing its educational and administrative services and programs and follows applicable federal and state law. This policy extends to the University’s electronic and information technologies (EIT).

Students with qualifying disabilities should contact the Disability Services Office at disabilityservices@byui.edu or 208-496-9210. Additional information about Disability Services resources can be found at [http://www.byui.edu/disabilities](http://www.byui.edu/disabilities).

## Academic Honesty

> “When you are honest in every way, you are able to enjoy peace of mind and maintain self-respect. You build strength of character, which allows you to be of service to God and others. You are trustworthy in the eyes of God and those around you. If you are dishonest in your words or actions, you hurt yourself and often hurt others as well. If you lie, steal, cheat, or neglect to give the full amount of work for your pay, you lose your self-respect. You lose the guidance of the Holy Ghost” (“Honesty,” True to the Faith (2004), 84)

Academic Honesty means students do their own work. This also means their instructors will evaluate that work. Students should not be dishonest—this includes all types of work in their courses. The complete Academic Honesty Policy can be found at [http://www.byui.edu/student-honor-office/ces-honor-code/academic-honesty](http://www.byui.edu/student-honor-office/ces-honor-code/academic-honesty).

## Academic Grievances

Students are encouraged to contact their instructors regarding course-related concerns. If concerns cannot be resolved in this way, students may contact the [BYU-Idaho Support Center](http://www.byui.edu/contact-us). to formally register a concern or grievance.

## Generative AI Policy

The "Generative AI Usage Policy" for the Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) Department provides guidelines for the ethical and practical use of generative AI in education and software development. It encourages students to utilize AI tools for enhancing learning, creativity, and productivity while requiring them to disclose AI assistance in their work. This policy aims to integrate generative AI into the curriculum, fostering a balanced and innovative learning environment.
