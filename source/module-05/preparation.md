## Module 05 - Preparation Reading &amp; Activities

## Your Project

!!! NOTE "Technology"

    This case study is open-ended, and you have the opportunity to choose the technology stack that you will use. You will discuss and agree as a team on the technology to utilize. Many individuals are tempted to using a technology that is familiar rather than the technology that is a best fit for the product. Don't be afraid to try new technologies.

    You will be required to write some code. Feel free to utilize online tutorials to help you or use other tools like ChatGPT to speed up the development process and help you get a minimum viable product.
