## Phases

### Phase 1: Planning and Requirements Gathering

Phase Objective: Define the project scope, gather requirements, and establish a clear understanding of stakeholder needs.

Tasks:

* Review stakeholder interviews with representatives from the Southern LA Volleyball Association to understand their pain points, challenges, and desired features.
* Define user personas representing players, parents, and tournament organizers to capture their specific requirements and preferences.
* Collaborate with the Product Manager to prioritize features and establish a product roadmap that aligns with business objectives.
* Develop user stories and acceptance criteria to guide the design and development process.

### Phase 2: Design and Prototype Development

Phase Objective: Create wireframes, prototypes, and design mockups to visualize the user interface and workflow of the application. Generate architecture diagrams and cost analysis.

Tasks:

* Work closely with the Product Designer to translate user requirements into intuitive interface designs.
* Iterate on wireframes and prototypes based on feedback from stakeholders and usability testing.
* Develop a design system and style guide to ensure consistency and coherence across the application.
* Collaborate with the Product Manager and Tech Lead to finalize feature prioritization and validate design decisions against technical constraints.
* Generate an architecture diagram of the needed cloud services needed as well as a cost estimate for the year.

### Phase 3: Implementation and Testing

Phase Objective: Build the cloud-based application according to the agreed-upon design and technical specifications.

Tasks:

* Divide development tasks among team members based on their areas of expertise and experience.
* Implement front-end and back-end components using cloud technologies.
* Conduct unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing to ensure the reliability, security, and performance of the application.
* Iterate on the implementation based on feedback from testing and address any bugs or issues promptly.

### Phase 4: Deployment and Evaluation

Phase Objective: Deploy the completed application to a cloud environment and evaluate its performance and usability.

Tasks:

* Coordinate with the Southern LA Volleyball Association to deploy the application to production servers and configure any necessary integrations.
* Conduct user acceptance testing (UAT) with stakeholders to validate that the application meets their expectations and resolves their pain points.
* Present the final product to the Southern LA Volleyball Association and receive approval for deployment.
