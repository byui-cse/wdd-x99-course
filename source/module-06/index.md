## Module 06 - Overview

This module your team is the product team responsible for the new "Slushie as a Service" product of Frazil. Your team is to *serve customers by creating a product that customers love, yet works for Frazil*. You will not be given a set of features to build, instead you are *empowered to solve these problems in the best way your team sees fit*. 

Your team will have 3 distinct roles that must be filled.

1.  **Product Manager** - ensures that the solutions are *valuable* (our retailers will buy the product and/or choose to use it), and *viable* it will meet the needs of the business.
2.  **Product Designer** - ensures that the solution is *usable*.
3.  **Tech Lead** - ensures that the solution is *feasible*.

Together, you own the problem and are responsible and accountable for the results.

## Strategic Context

	<h5>Kyle Freebairn, CEO</h5>
	<blockquote><p>Traditionally, a convenience store or chain that wanted to get into the frozen beverage category would buy a machine from a provider, and then buy the slush mix or concentrate from a manufacturer. As the machine broke down over time, it was up to the retailer to hire a third-party service provider to come and fix it. </p><p>Itâ€™s actually a pretty horrible experience for the store manager. Frazil was built on this hypothesis that we should combine these things into one cohesive experience that we manage on behalf of retailers.</p>

!!! note "Product Discovery"

    A main focus of this is module is product discovery. One main principle of product discovery is that *our customers and our stakeholders aren't able to tell us what to build*. 

    There are two reasons for this. First, the customers and stakeholders don't know what is just now possible&mdash;they are not experts in the enabling technologies, so they can't be expected to know the best way to solve the problems we're focused on, or even know if the problem is possible to solve. Second, with technology products, it's very hard to predict in advance what solutions will work.

    We refer to this as product *discovery* to acknowledge that we understand what we can't know in advance, and to emphasize that our task is to *discover* a solution that is *valuable*, *usable*, *feasible*, and *viable*.
