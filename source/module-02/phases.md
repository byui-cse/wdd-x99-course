## Phases

This project is broken into 7 phases:


1.	Create an architecture diagram and cost estimate for the solution.
2.	Use AWS Cloud9 to access the web server. Observe the access logs that are generated when you browse the website.
3.	Install and configure the Amazon CloudWatch agent and the configuration file (httpd.conf) for the Apache web server so that access and error logs can be collected and sent to CloudWatch.
4.	Confirm that the web server generates logs that the CloudWatch agent collects and sends to CloudWatch.
5.	Use simulated logs and ensure that CloudWatch receives these logs.
6.	Use CloudWatch Logs Insights to query the access log group and generate visualizations.
7.	Adjust the analytics pipeline to deliver new insights with visitor geolocation data. Create a dashboard that the café owner can use to make decisions.
