## Module 02 - From Facade to Function - Building your MVP

Now that you've completed your Design Sprint and gathered real customer feedback, it's time to take the next big step: building your *Minimum Viable Product (MVP)*. Your MVP is not a rough draft or an early version of your final product—it's the *smallest possible product that delivers real value to users* and gives you *real learning about your product’s potential*.

This sprint is about moving from assumptions to evidence-based development. You’ll take what you learned from testing your facade prototype and make intentional decisions about what to build, what to change, and what to drop. If your product didn’t resonate with users during the design sprint, that’s okay—in fact, that’s expected. In this case, you’ll return to the drawing board and run a *second, smaller design sprint*. This way, you can be confident you’re not wasting engineering time on features no one wants.

From here on out, your team will follow an *agile workflow*. That means stand-ups at the beginning of each class, sprint planning, and continuous collaboration. Your focus should always be on *solving real user problems*, not just shipping features.


## Key Goals for Sprint 2:

* Build a functional MVP based on validated customer needs
* Integrate meaningful feedback from your initial prototype
* Start using agile practices for planning and progress tracking
* Continue validating your product with real users

## TODO Items for this Module:

### Product Manager

* Recruit 5 new customers (in addition to previous testers) for usability testing at the end of this sprint
* Write lightweight problem statements for any new functionality the team is considering
* Maintain a living backlog of hypotheses to validate and customer pain points

### Tech Lead

* Create and maintain a Git repository; ensure all team members have access
* Set up a Trello, Jira, or GitHub Projects board for organizing sprint tasks
* Collaborate closely with design and PM to scope what is technically feasible within the sprint

### Product Designer

* Update interface and interaction designs based on customer feedback
* Build out user flows that reflect changes to the product vision
* Work with the Tech Lead to ensure designs are realistic and buildable within the sprint

### Full Team

* Identify and estimate tasks needed to build a working MVP
* Focus on problem-solution fit: Does what we’re building actually solve the user’s problem?
* Use a stand-up format at the start of each class (What did you do? What are you doing? Any blockers?)
* Prioritize outcomes, not features: Why are we building this, and how will we know it’s successful?
* Start Building!!! 

## SVPG Product Mindset to Embrace This Sprint:

    !!! note "Silicon Valley Product Group"

    We'll be using ideas from [*Silicon Valley Product Group (SVPG)*](https://www.svpg.com) in this course. SVPG is made up of some of the most experienced and respected product leaders in the tech industry. Their mission is to share proven principles and practices that help teams build products customers love. Unlike traditional approaches that separate planning, design, and engineering, SVPG emphasizes deep collaboration across roles, constant discovery, and building only what adds real value. Their philosophy helps teams avoid wasting time on features nobody uses and instead focus on solving meaningful problems in ways that are usable, valuable, and feasible. In this course, we’ll be drawing on SVPG’s ideas to help you build smarter, faster, and more customer-focused products.

* *Product Discovery never stops* – keep talking to customers even while building
* *Good products solve hard problems in valuable ways* – don’t just aim for “done,” aim for “impactful”
* *Engineers, Designers, and Product Managers are co-owners of product success* – decisions should never be siloed
* *The team is empowered* to identify how to solve a problem; *they also bear the responsibility* of how well that solution solves the needs of the customer.
